TEXT:
------------------
Stay tonight.
Just you and me
Hold me tight.
Tonight I’m free.

You are my heart,
My only truth,
You feel so far,
I still choose you.

I think about you a lot.
I don’t need gold.
I've been through a lot.
All I want is you to hold.

You are the reason I breathe.
you love took full control
I'll grit my teeth,
You’re taking my soul.

Stay tonight.
Just you and me.
Hold me tight.
Tonight I’m free.
