TEXT:
------------------
Stay tonight.
Just you and me
Hold me tight.
Tonight I’m free.

You are my heart.
With you, my love.
From the start.
Sent from above.

I think about you a lot.
I don’t need gold.
I've been through a lot.
All I want is you to hold.

You are the reason I breathe.
You look at me—I’m losing control.
Your touch makes me believe.
You’re taking my soul.

Stay tonight.
Just you and me.
Hold me tight.
Tonight I’m free.
