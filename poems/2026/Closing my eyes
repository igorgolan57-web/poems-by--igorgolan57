TEXT:
------------------
Closing my eyes, I drift away. 
To a place I used to know. 
Where tenderness is here to stay, 
And sorrow has a silver lining's glow.

[Verse 2] Where love is clear as crystal glass,
And dreams are bathed in golden sun. 
Where hopes were thin as ice, alas, 
And we were young, the naive ones.

[Verse 3] The silence there is loud and deep. 
With clumsy words we failed to find. 
But one stray look I’ll always keep, 
That sent a chill down my spine.

[Verse 4] The moment when we brushed so slight, 
A touch of skin, a spark so near. 
I lost my breath throughout the night. 
To feel you close, to hold you dear.

[Verse 5] It’s the echo of our love, you see, 
Like a sacred, ancient rhyme. 
That I keep under lock and key, 
In the labyrinths of my mind.

[Verse 6] Closing my eyes, I drift away. 
To a place I used to know. 
Where tenderness is here to stay, 
And sorrow has a silver lining's glow.
